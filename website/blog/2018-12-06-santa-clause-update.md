So over 2 months have passed since the last blog entry - much have changed. It's all described in 
[ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) on github, so there's no reason for  rewriting 
it again. 

One big change is [`Pattern building`](/docs/pattern-building) - which lets you handle user input or unsafe characters 
in your patterns. It's got a dedicated section in [Docs](/docs/handling-user-input), too.

Except for that, there's a discussion section in [Help](/help) - feel free to ask questions or propose features!
