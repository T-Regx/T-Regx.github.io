Hello there! Another update, this time there's more to it - much has changed.

Here's a quick list:
 - ReadMe.md is now more throughout
 - CleanRegex runs on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Danon/T-Regx) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/Danon/T-Regx?branch=master)
 - The library can now be required using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
 - CleanRegex supports `PHP 5.3`
 - Handling compile pattern exceptions and runtime pattern exceptions
 - Passing callbacks with detailed object parameters (`Match` and `ReplaceMatch`).
 - Add a facade `Pattern::of()`

And also I'd like to give a quick thanks to Bartek - my friend currently working at Thulium - for a nice suggestion :)

I plan on supporting older versions of PHP by maintaining two branches: `master` and `master-php5.3`. I will develop
CleanRegex on `master` with PHP 7.1, and with each release, I will merge `master` to `master-php5.3` and remove any
PHP 5.3 incompatibilities (type hints, scalar arguments, etc.).

I will not remove other incompatibilities, like missing constants, non-existent methods, etc. because code on `master` 
will be developed not to relay on those that much. I will also write unit tests for breaking PHP changes. Some of them 
will be skipped for PHP 7.1+, and some for PHP <7.1. 

PS: Just letting you know that I plan on investing more time in maintaining CleanRegex now :)
