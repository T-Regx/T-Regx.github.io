author: Daniel Wilkowski

Heey!

We've release T-Regx [0.9.14](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/releases/tag/v0.9.14).

We changed T-Regx quite a bit with all the breaking changes, we'll try to minimise it in the future.
All the changes are listed in [ChangeLog.md].

In this release we added two major new features: formats and replace expectations.

Formats, using `Pattern::format()` allow you to build a real regular expressions using an arbitrary
"mask" or "format string".

Replacement expectations add methods to control how many replacements were performed, you can now
count the amount of replacements performed with `counting()`, and methods `exactly()`, `atLeast()`, and `atMost()`
are a simplification of `counting()`, which simply validate whether the replacements performed
match the expectations.
