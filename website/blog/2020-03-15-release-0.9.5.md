This release brings alternation in prepared patterns!

Up to this point, there was no reasonable way to create a pattern from a variable number of inputs, for example
you allow your users to input 0, 1 or more tags, which later should be used in a pattern. In procedural world, probably
`array_map()` with `preg::quote()` would do the job, but wait! You don't have to code, it's already here:

```php
Pattern::bind('^user:@id/findBy:@tags/all$', [
  'id'   => $user->id,
  'tags' => $_GET['tags']
]);
```

In other words:

```php
Pattern::bind('My tag is: "@tags"', ['tags' => ['one', 'two', 'three']]);
```
creates a pattern:
```
/My tag is: "(one|two|three)"/
```

Rest assured:
 - the values are quoted with `preg::quote()`, to protect you from malicious code
 - the group is non-capturing (use `'My tag is: "(@tags)"'` for a capturing group, to be used with `group()`)

The alternation is really smart too - if you use `i` or `u` flag, T-Regx will perform certain optimization, 
for example:
```php
Pattern::inject('Find: @ :)', [['foo', 'bar', 'FOO']], 'i');
```
then it wil collapse `foo` and `FOO`, since `i` flag is used:
```
/Find: (foo|bar) :)/
```

That's it in this release! Stay tuned :)
