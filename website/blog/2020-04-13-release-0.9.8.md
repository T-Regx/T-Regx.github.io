### Iterables

Up to this point, you could either use T-Regx methods that return `array`, in order to iterate them, or use
one of the collection methods [`map()`], [`forEach()`], `filter()`, etc.

Right now any chainable method in T-Regx is also iterate
```
foreach (pattern('\d+')->match('127.0.0.1') as $match) {
```
```
foreach (pattern('\d+')->match('127.0.0.1')->asInt() as $digit) {
```
```
foreach (pattern('\d+')->match('127.0.0.1')->all() as $text) {
```

### Shorthand method

In addition to previous release, when we added `asArray()` method, we also added a shorthand `get()` method for 
capturing groups.

```
pattern('(origin/)?master')->match('master')->first(function (Match $match) {
    $match->get(1); // same as $match->group(1)->text();
});
```
