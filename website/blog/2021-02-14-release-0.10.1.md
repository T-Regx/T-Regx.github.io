Rawwrrrr!

We've release T-Regx [0.10.1](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/releases/tag/v0.10.1).

This time, we've updated match filtering. Previously, methods `filter()` used on regular match pattern,
it would filter only [`Detail`], and have exactly alike interface as the said match pattern
(like a filtering decorator), yet `fluent()->filter()` simply removed entries from the fluent stream. 
We don't like that difference.

So we renamed `match()->filter()` to `match()->remaining()`, since that looks more like a decorator it is,
and we added new `match()->filter()` method which works like `all()`, but it only returns the items
matching the predicate (like [`array_filter`]).

Apart from that, we fixed a bug that was lurking in `fluent()->flatMap()` (don't worry, it's gone now :), as
well as improving the `fluent()->first()`. Now, when filtering a fluent stream, calling `first()` first calls
[`preg_match()`], and if it matches the predicate, that [`Detail`] is simply returned. If the first [`Detail`]
isn't matched by the predicate, then it calls [`preg_match_all()`] and returns the first detail
from that, that matches the predicate.

As always, everything is described in [ChangeLog.md] on github.
