One update about groups, not to cause confusion. `$match->groups()` treats indexes a bit different than `$match->group(int)`.

Everyone who worked with regular expressions knows, that group `0` is a whole match. I don't want to break 
that convention. So I assumed that they must be equal:
```php
$match->group(0) === $match->text()
```

Having said that, I still want to distinguish a method which returns groups and the one that returns a whole match. 
So `$match->groups()` **doesn't** return the whole match at index `0`, while `$match->group()` does.

<!--truncate-->

You can think of `$this->group(int)` method as:
```php
return [$this->text(), ...$this->groups()];
```

So...
```php
$match->group(0) == $match->text();
$match->group(1) == $match->groups()[0];
$match->group(2) == $match->groups()[1];
$match->group(3) == $match->groups()[2];
$match->group(4) == $match->groups()[3];
```

And a quick update about the CleanRegex:

- I added a `ReadMeTest` testcase, which asserts that all code used in ReadMe.md has the presented results.
- New `->first()`, `->all()` and `->only()` methods to **explicitly** match/replace certain amount of occurrences. 
  This will also be used with capturing groups.
