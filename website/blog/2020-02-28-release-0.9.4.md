title: Release 0.9.4 - Exception changes and groupBy()

This release brings updates in exceptions (namespaces, new detailed exceptions) and a `groupBy()` method.

### Exceptions

In previous release we renamed `SafeRegexException` to `PregException`. In this, we're renaming `CleanRegexException` to `PatternException`. So now, those two general exceptions sync nicely with their base methods:

```php
try {
  return preg::match('/Foo/', $subject);
} catch (PregException $e) {
```

```php
try {
  return pattern('Foo')->test($subject);
} catch (PatternException $e) {
```

They both extend `RegexException` - base for all exceptions thrown by T-Regx. So that's the first thing.

The second exception update - previously, every exception thrown based on `preg_last_error()` method was `RuntimePregException`. Now, each error has a dedicated exception, which can be caught separately:
```php
try {
  return preg::match($pattern, $subject);
} catch (BacktrackLimitPregException $exception) {
} catch (Utf8OffsetPregException $exception) {
```
The detailed list of changes is in [ChangeLog.md].

### `groupBy()`

This release also comes with a brand new method - `groupBy()` which groups matches by a capturing group (name or index). It can match strings, offsets and also map them with `map()` and `flatMap()`. Additionally, it can be chained with `filter()` to leave out unwanted matches:
```php
return pattern('(\d)(?<unit>cm|mm)')->match($strings)
  ->filter(function (Match $match) {
    return $match->group(1)->toInt() % 2 == 0;
  })
  ->groupBy('unit')
  ->map(function (Match $match) {
    return $match->group(1)->toInt() * 100;
  });
```
