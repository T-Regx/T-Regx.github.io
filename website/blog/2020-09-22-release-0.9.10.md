We've released T-Regx 0.9.10, where we delivered what we described in previous blog post.

There are some renames to make some methods more clear.  We also added `pattern()->match()->tuple()` 
and `pattern()->match()->triple()` helper methods.

As always, everything is described in [ChangeLog.md] on github.

PS: `Pattern::prepare()` is removed in this release, but is restored back in 0.9.11.
