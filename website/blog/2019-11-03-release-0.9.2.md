ðŸ˜Ž T-Regx is more than happy to announce its third alpha version!! As mentioned, despite the `alpha` suffix, it's 100% suitable for production use. It doesn't have any known bugs - it's just missing a few time-consuming features.

What's new in this release:

* Breaking changes
    * Constructor `new Pattern()` is no longer a part of T-Regx API. Use `Pattern::of()`/`pattern()`
    * Renamed `Match.parseInt()` to `Match.toInt()` (the same for `MatchGroup`)
    * Removed `pattern()->match()->test()`/`fails()`. From now on, use `pattern()->test()`/`fails()`
    * Removed `is()`:
        - `is()->delimited()`
        - `is()->usabled()`
        - `is()->valid()` is changed to `valid()`
* Features
    * Added `Match.group().replace()` ðŸ”¥
    * Added `pattern()->match()->fluent()` ðŸ”¥
    * Added `pattern()->match()->asInt()`
    * Added `pattern()->match()->distinct()` (leaves only unique matches)
    * Added prepared pattern method `Pattern::inject()`/`Pattern::bind()` (see below)
    * In `pattern()->match()->groups()`:
        * Added `groups()->forEach()`/`iterate()`
        * Added `groups()->flatMap()`
        * Added `groups()->map()`
        * Added `group()->fluent()`
        * Added `groups()->names()` (and `namedGroups()->names()`)
        * Added `groups()->count()` (and `namedGroups()->count()`)
    * Added `pattern()->forArray()->strict()` which throws for invalid values, instead of filtering them out
* SafeRegex
    * Added `preg::grep_keys()` ðŸ”¥, that works exactly like `preg::grep()`, but filters by keys (also accepts [`PREG_GREP_INVERT`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-grep.php))
    * Methods `preg::grep()`, `preg::replace_callback()` and `preg::replace_callback_array()` are now protected from throwing Fatal Errors.
* Enhancements/updates
    * Method `by()->group()->orElse()` now receives lazy-loaded `Match`, instead of a subject
    * Added `withReferences()` to `CompositePattern.chainedReplace()`
    * Previously named `Pattern::inject()` is renamed to `Pattern::bind()`
    * The `Pattern::bind()` (old `Pattern::inject()`) still accepts values as an associative array, but new `Pattern::inject()` receives values without regard for the keys.
    * Fixed passing invalid types to `forArray()`. Previously, caused fatal error due to internal implementation.
* Other
    * Now `MalformedPatternException` is thrown, instead of `CompileSafeRegexException`, when using invalid PCRE syntax.
    * Returning `Match` from `replace()->callback()` (instead of `Match.text()` as `string`)
    * Match `+12` is no longer considered a valid integer for `isInt()`/`toInt()`
    * Unnamed group will be represented as `null` in `Match.groupNames()`, instead of being simply ignored
* Maintenance
    * PhpUnit throws different exceptions because of [PHP `__toString()` exception policy change](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tostring_exceptions).
