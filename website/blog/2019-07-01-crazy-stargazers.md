Holy guacamole! There were only 30 stars a few weeks ago and we have 40 already!? :D You guys gave us even more
reason to release T-Regx 0.9.2 even sooner! Two new features are coming:
 - In-group replacing ðŸ˜² You can now replace a single group inside your subject 
   (not only in `replace()`, in any method with [`Match`](/docs/match-details) details)
 - Additional prepared patterns method - `Pattern::bind()`

So keep an eye for 0.9.2 release.
