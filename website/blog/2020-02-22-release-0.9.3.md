That's a really quick update, we just found a PHP bug report [#78853](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=78853), 
that's probably going to be fixed in future versions of PHP, but we decided to include the bugfix in T-Regx
so it's fixed in PHP 7.1 (if you're using T-Regx :)

Apart from that, we added `preg::last_error_msg()`, which returns the same data as `preg::last_error()`, but in
in human-readable `string`. There are suggestions on PHP source code, that this method might become part of standard
PHP library, so we at T-Regx thought we might include it already :) And if it's not included, after all, that's still
a good idea to have this method :)

And there are some breaking changes, that should increase readability, for example this exception:

```
try {
  return preg::match('/pattern/', $word)
}
catch (PregException $e) {
```

seems a bit more intuitive than

```
catch (SafeRegexException $e) {
```

So to name the exception based on a class/method, not the module :)

And FIY, the next feature we're working at T-Regx is `groupBy()`, which should complete `groupByCallback()`
functionality already present in T-Regx. So expect that method first! :)

That's it for today, thanks guys!
