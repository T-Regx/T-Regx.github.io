author: Daniel Wilkowski

Rawwrrrr!

We've release T-Regx [0.10.0](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/releases/tag/v0.10.0).

In that change, there's only added support for PHP8, which is handling of PHP8 change in methods
contracts, and removal of previously deprecated [`Match`][1], since [`match`][2] is now a keyword in PHP.

As always, everything is described in [ChangeLog.md] on github.
