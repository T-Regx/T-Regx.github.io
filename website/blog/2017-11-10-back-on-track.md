I'm here just to give you, guys, a quick update and sum up what's been going on.

So, I'm pretty happy with how's the lib looking right now :) There's a pretty throughout ReadMe.md 
there on [CleanRegex](https://github.com/Danon/T-Regx) github, but I bet you I'll expand it with more examples :)

The library, actually, already looks like how I imagined it and how I will try to make it look in the end, which is:
 - Based on exceptions
 - Overly simple set of chainable methods
 - Wrapping `null`s, `false`es and empty and nested arrays with clean API.
