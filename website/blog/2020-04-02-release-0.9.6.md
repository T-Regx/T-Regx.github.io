Another release ahead of us. This one is about T-Regx chainable interface. We made sure, that `first()`
chained with anything always uses `preg_match()`, instead of `preg_match_all()`.

For example:

```php
pattern($pattern)->match($subject)
    ->fluent()
    ->flatMap(function (Match $match) {
        return [$match->text() => $match->offset()];
    })
    ->keys()
    ->groupByCallback(function (string $text) {
        return $text[0];
    })
    ->first();
```

this code will now use `preg_match()`. Really, this whole release was about ensuring that.

The only exception is `filter()`, for which it would be really wasteful to call `preg_match()` first, and then, 
if the filter has failed, call `preg_match_all()`.

In the future releases we'll make sure that the exception for unmatched `first()` are also
uniform (probably `SubjectNotMatchedException`, instead of `NoSuchFluentElementException`).

Boy, are design patterns so cool for this kind of job ;D
