title: Release 0.9.12 Oopsie
author: Daniel Wilkowski
---

Heey, there and sorry!

In previous release, 0.9.11 we accidentally made `replace()->by()->group()->orThrow()` 
parameter non-optional, which resulted in `TypeError` error. We fixed it immediately, 
so here's v0.9.12 with a fix :) Nothing more. Update ASAP.

As always, everything is described in [ChangeLog.md] on github.
