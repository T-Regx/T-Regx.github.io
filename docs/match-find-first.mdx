title: Optional matches (Find first)

import {CodeTabs, Result} from './code';

If you call [`first()`] on a subject that isn't matched by a pattern - `SubjectNotMatchedException` is
thrown. We discussed that in the previous chapter.

But what if you **expected** the subject not to be matched? And how do you to react to it? 

## Optional matches with `findFirst()`

Method `findFirst()` can be called with a callback (that accepts [`Match`] details) just
like [`first()`]. The difference is: `findFirst()` never throws `SubjectNotMatchedException`, and allows you to control
an unmatched subject by appropriate control methods: `orThrow()`, `orReturn()` and `orElse()`.

For example:

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm 19 years old")
   ->findFirst(function (Match $match) {
       // highlight-next-line
       return "I was born $match years ago";
   })
   ->orReturn('Unmatched :/');`}
    php={`if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm 19 years old", $match)) {
    $text = $match[0];
    // highlight-next-line
    return "I was born $text years ago";
}
return 'Unmatched :/';`}/>
<Result>'I was born 19 years ago'</Result>

If a match is found, then the result of `findFirst()` callback is returned. If a match is not found, however, then the 
handling of an unmatched subject relies in the chained method.

### `orReturn()`

If a match is not found, it returns a default value.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm a dog")
    ->findFirst(function (Match $match) {
       return "I was born $match years ago";
    })
    // highlight-next-line
    ->orReturn("Match is not found");`}
    php={`if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm a dog", $match)) {
    $text = $match[0];
    return "I was born $text years ago";
}
// highlight-next-line
return "Match is not found";`}/>
<Result>'Match is not found'</Result>

### `orElse()`

If a match is not found, it calls `orElse()` callback and uses *it* to evaluate a return value.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm a dog")
    ->findFirst(function (Match $match) {
       return "I was born $match years ago";
    })
    ->orElse(function (NotMatched $notMatched) { 
        // highlight-next-line
        return "I couldn't match subject: " . $notMatched->subject();
    });`}
    php={`$subject = "I'm a dog";
if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', $subject, $match)) {
    $text = $match[0];
    return "I was born $text years ago";
}
// highlight-next-line
return "I couldn't match subject: $subject";`}/>
<Result>"I couldn't match subject: I'm a dog"</Result>

Callback of `orElse()` is called with `NotMatched`, which contains only a handful of methods
present in [`Match`]: `subject()`, `groupNames()`, `groupsCount()` and `hasGroup($nameOrIndex)`.

### `orThrow()`

If a match is not found, it throws `SubjectNotMatchedException` by default.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`try {
    return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm a dog")
        ->findFirst(function (Match $match) {
            return "Match is found!";
        })
        // highlight-next-line
        ->orThrow();
}
catch (SubjectNotMatchedException $e) {
    // React to an unmatched subject
    echo "Not matched: " . $e->getMessage();
}`}
     php={`try {
    if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm a dog")) {
        return "Match is found!";
    }
    // highlight-next-line
    throw new SubjectNotMatchedException(
        // highlight-next-line
        'Expected to get the first match, but subject was not matched',
        // highlight-next-line
        "I'm a dog");
}
catch (SubjectNotMatchedException $e) {
    // React to an unmatched subject
    echo "Not matched: " . $e->getMessage();
}`}/>

### Custom exceptions for `orThrow()`

You can also supply your own exception class name.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`class MyException extends \\Exception {}\n
try {
    return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm a dog")
        ->findFirst(function (Match $match) {
            return "Match is found!";
        })
        // highlight-next-line
        ->orThrow(MyException::class);
}
catch (MyException $e) {
    // React to an unmatched subject
    echo "Not matched: " . $e->getMessage();
}`}
     php={`class MyException extends \\Exception {}\n
try {
    if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm a dog")) {
        return "Match is found!";
    } 
    // highlight-next-line
    throw new MyException('Expected to get the first match, but subject was not matched');
}
catch (MyException $e) {
    // React to an unmatched subject
    echo "Not matched: " . $e->getMessage();
}`}/>

Of course, your custom exception must meet certain requirements:

- **It has to be a class**
  
  Trying to instantiate interfaces or abstract classes would break our "Explicity rule"
  The class must be concrete and explicit.

- **It has to implement `\Throwable`**
  
  Obviously.

- **It must have a suitable constructor**

  The class must be instantiable with one of the following signatures and parameter types.

   - `__construct()`
   - `__construct($message)`, where `$message` can be a string
   - `__construct($message, $subject)`, where `$message` and `$subject` can be strings

> Notice, that using `findFirst()->orThrow()` without your custom exception is **identical** to `first()`.

## I don't like functional

If you don't like functional programming style, you are free to use [`first()`]
(which throws an exception) and just catch it.

<CodeTabs
    tregx={`try {
    // highlight-next-line
    return pattern('[0-9]+')->match("I'm a dog")->first();
}
catch (SubjectNotMatchedException $e) {
    return "Some other value";
}`}
    php={`try {
    if (preg::match('/[0-9]+/', "I'm a dog", $match)) {
        return $match[0];
    }
    // highlight-next-line
    throw new SubjectNotMatchedException();
}
catch (SubjectNotMatchedException $e) {
    return 'Some other value';
}`}/>
