title: What's T-Regx?
---

T-Regx (_T-Rex and RegExp_) is a lightweight, high-level Regular Expressions library.

Its main features are:

- Standard **and** new functions:
  - You can stay with known `preg_match()`, `preg_replace()` functions
  - You can use new `pattern()` function
  - You can use either; you can use both; you can interchange them

- API:
  - [Automatic delimiters](delimiters.mdx) for your patterns
  - UTF-8 support out of the box
  - Unifying differences between matching, replacing, splitting into one interface: [`Match`]
  - [Prepared Patterns](prepared-patterns.md) handling unsafe characters (e.g. user input)

- Removing headaches of PHP:
  - You only use `try`/`catch`.

    T-Regx is doing all the `if`ology around `preg` under the hood, to unify all PHP corner-cases and map them to
    exceptions (see ["Comparison"](/comparison)).
  - All **false positives** and **false negatives** are eliminated

- If anything - Exceptions!:
  - Magic values (like `null`, `false`, `''`, `[]`, `-1`) aren't used -> Exceptions
  - Handles every `warning`/`error`/`fatal error`/`notice` -> Exception
  - `preg_last_error()` isn't required to verify errors -> Exception
  - `errors`/bugs/`gotcha's` aren't silently ignored -> Exception
  - supplied invalid arguments aren't silently ignored -> Exception
  - returned invalid values aren't silently ignored -> Exception

Additionally:

  - Each function obeys SRP
  - Functionalities are represented with `methods()` (not `FLAGS` or arguments)
  - No default `parameters=null`
  - No `PREG_FLAGS, 1`
  - No `varargs...`

## PHP's magic values

In vanilla PHP, different methods (`preg_match()`, `preg_replace()`, `preg_split()`, etc.) return different types and
values, that are *symbolic*. For some it's `null`, for other `[]` or `false` or `-1` - they're all supposed to mean "error".
Of course you have to remember which is `=== false` and which `=== null`.

T-Regx will **never** return `null`, `false` an empty array or other magic value. `MalformedPatternException` is thrown if `$pattern` is malformed.

And it's not just the return values, `$match` results also contain magic values like `""` which can either mean
the group wasn't matched, or it matched an empty string in PHP. In CleanRegex this is handled, so you don't have to worry
about it - In T-Regx, `""` always means an empty string.
