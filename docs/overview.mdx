title: What's T-Regx?
---

T-Regx (_T-Rex and RegExp_) is a lightweight, high-level Regular Expressions library.

Its main features are:

- API:
  - [Automatic delimiters](delimiters.mdx) for your patterns
  - UTF-8 support out of the box
  - Unifying differences between matching, replacing, splitting... (with [`Match`], instead of `string[][]`)
  - [Prepared Patterns](prepared-patterns.md) handling unsafe characters (e.g. user-input)

- Removing headaches of PHP:
  - `if()`ing around `preg_` methods, to unify PHP corner-cases with exceptions (see ["Comparison"](/comparison))
  - All **false positives** and **false negatives** are eliminated

- Exceptions:
  - Magic values (like `null`, `false`, `''`, `[]`, `-1`) are removed as error indicators -> Exceptions
  - Handles every `warning`/`error`/`fatal error`/`notice` -> Exception
  - `preg_last_error()` isn't required to verify errors -> Exception
  - `errors`/bugs/`gotcha's` aren't silently ignored -> Exception
  - supplied invalid arguments aren't silently ignored -> Exception

Additionally:

  - Each function obeys SRP
  - Functionalities are represented with `methods()` (not `FLAGS` or arguments)
  - No default `parameters=null`
  - No `PREG_FLAGS, 1`
  - No `varargs...`

## PHP's magic values

In vanilla PHP, different methods (`preg_match()`, `preg_replace()`, `preg_split()`, etc.) return different types and
values, that are supposed to mean something. For some it's `null`, for other `[]` or `false` or `-1`.

T-Regx results will **never** contain `null`, `false` or an empty array. `MalformedPatternException` would be thrown,
if `$pattern` is malformed. It would also throw `SubjectNotMatchedException` if the `$pattern` doesn't match the `$subject`.
Even if `first()` does return `''`, it's only because it supposed to do that; that is "when a pattern matched
a string of length 0". It also never raises any warnings or fatal errors, like vanilla-PHP would.
