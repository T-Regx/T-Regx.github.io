Thanks to automatic delimiters, one can use regular expressions without [brain strain](overview.md#brain-strain)
and without coming up with a suitable delimiter.

```php
pattern('#[A-Z]/[a-z]+')->match($subject)->first();
```

## Adding delimiters

To change undelimited pattern into a delimited one - use `delimiter()` method;

<Tabs defaultValue="T-Regx" values={[{label: 'T-Regx', value: 'T-Regx'}]}>
<TabItem value="T-Regx">

```php
pattern('Welcome/Or not')->delimiter();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!--T-Regx:{echo-at(0)}-->
<!--Result-Output-->

<div className="output-block">

```text
#Welcome/Or not#
```
</div>

> `delimiter()` returns the pattern unchanged, as if it was constructed with `Pattern::pcre()`, instead of `Pattern::of()`.

## Flags

There are two ways of passing flags:

Either pass a second argument to the [`pattern()`](introduction.md#entry-points)/[`Pattern::of()`](introduction.md#entry-points):

```php
// global function
pattern('[A-Z][a-z]+', 'i')->match($subject)->first();

// static method
Pattern::of('[A-Z][a-z]+', 'i')->match($subject)->first();
```

or use old-school pattern:

```php
Pattern::pcre('/[A-Z][a-z]+/i')->match($subject)->first();
```

## I want to break it

T-Regx has a set of predefined, suitable delimiters (like `/`, `#`, `~`, `%`, etc.) and simply uses the first one,
that doesn't occur in your pattern. If you exhaust each of them; if you use every possible, predefined, suitable delimiter -
it will throw `ExplicitDelimiterRequiredException`.

In that case, you simply have to use an explicit delimiter with `Pattern::pcre()`.

If you think another automatic delimiter can be used,
please create [a github issue](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/issues/new/choose).
